# HFalasco-Corner-Grocer-
Project for SNHU
This project was done for my final project for SNHU CS-210 course
This code is a basic setup that allows users to input an item; the program will then edit an external file to add the item,
later the user can then choose to print the frequencies of some items and even print a Histogram version of this data
the code also includes backup data that, if it isn't detected immediately, will create one itself
For my skill level personally, Creating and writing backup data is the part that I am most impressed with myself for
I believe that I could have created a way to read the backup data; however, as it is normally inaccessible 
writing the program to automatically read backup if any errors are detected with the original read and write file would be the best fix for this
as well as writing the same line of code that searches and creates a backup file for the main read and write file as well
the most challenging part of this code was writing  with maps; this is still a subject that I am learning about, so this was a particular challenge for me, even though it seems quite straightforward.
The skills that I gained from this project centered mostly around file read-write and file creation, A field that I also felt pretty uncomfortable about, but I am now confident that I know the basics in how it works.
To make this program maintainable and adaptable, everything is built off functions in this code, and a lot of the functions are pretty simple, just with slight differences, I think to increase the functionality of this
making these functions into classes would have been the better choice.
